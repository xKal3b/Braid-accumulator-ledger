Braid-Accumulator Ledger (BAL) — A novel consensus and state model beyond blockchains and DAGs. BAL uses scope-partitioned fibers, cryptographic accumulators, and periodic BFT checkpoints over root vectors to achieve scalability, reorg-resistant finality, and efficient light-client verification.

## Overview

The **Braid-Accumulator Ledger (BAL)** is a novel consensus and data structure model that challenges the ordering assumptions of blockchains and DAGs.  

Instead of enforcing global or partial transaction ordering, BAL treats state updates as **commutative deltas** scoped to **independent fibers**. Each fiber maintains **cryptographic accumulators** for effect sets and spent-sets. Periodically, validators finalize a **vector of fiber roots** using a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol.  

The result:  
- **No reorgs** (checkpoint vectors are final).  
- **Scalability** through parallel fibers.  
- **Light-client friendly** with O(1) verification per fiber.  
- **Reduced MEV exposure**, as ordering is confined only to order-islands.

## Features

- **Fibers:** deterministic sub-ledgers for assets, contracts, or namespaces.  
- **Deltas:** commutative state updates validated by signatures and witnesses.  
- **Accumulators:** cryptographic roots proving membership/non-membership.  
- **Checkpoints:** periodic BFT consensus on root vectors, not transactions.  
- **Conflict Resolution:** deterministic via verifiable random functions (VRFs).  
- **Cross-Fiber Atomicity:** two-phase escrow or order-island mediation.

## Use Cases

- **Payments:** nonce-based capability transfers with compact proofs.  
- **NFTs:** ownership as membership in accumulators; atomic bundle trades.  
- **Social Identity & Messaging:** CRDT-style updates scoped to user fibers.  
- **DeFi:** order-dependent logic isolated in order-islands.  
- **Oracles & Bridges:** accumulator proofs exported to external systems.  
- **Enterprise Compliance:** private fibers with selective disclosure.

## Academic Context

BAL synthesizes concepts from prior works:  
- Blockchains (Nakamoto consensus, Ethereum finality).  
- DAG protocols (Avalanche, IOTA, Hashgraph).  
- Accumulators & stateless blockchain research (Boneh, Bünz, Kate).  
- Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs).  
- Data availability sampling (Celestia, recent modular blockchain research).  

By elevating **accumulators** to the role of the ledger substrate, BAL reframes consensus as agreement on **set membership** rather than **transaction order**.
