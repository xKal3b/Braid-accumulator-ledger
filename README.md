# Braid-accumulator-ledger
Braid-Accumulator Ledger (BAL) â€” A novel consensus and state model beyond blockchains and DAGs. BAL uses scope-partitioned fibers, cryptographic accumulators, and periodic BFT checkpoints over root vectors to achieve scalability, reorg-resistant finality, and efficient light-client verification.
